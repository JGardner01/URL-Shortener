# URL-Shortener
## Overview
URL Shortener is a Flask based application designed to allow users to create short, customisable URLs and generate QR codes for easy sharing and access. This application also includes features such as URL management and monitoring, user accounts for long term access, browser sessions for temporary tracking and Google Safe Browsing integration to ensure the safety of all URLS. This project provides a secure and efficient way to manage and share links.

## Features
- **Customised Links:**
  - **Custom Short Links:** Create personalised short URLs.
  - **Expiration Dates:** Set custom expiration dates, with a default of 30 days.
  - **Click Limits:** Limit the number of times a link can be accessed.
  - **Password Protection:** Secure short URLs with passwords.
- **QR Code Generation:** Automatically generate QR codes for each shortened URL.
- **Dashboard:** Manage, edit, track and share shortened URLs through an intuitive dashboard.
- **User Accounts:** Use an account to manage and track your URLs across different sessions and devices.
- **Browser Sessions:** Access and monitor shortened URLs without requiring an account within your current browser session.
- **Google Safe Browsing API:** Checks the safety of URLs before shortening to avoid malicious sites.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Main programming language used for the backend
- **Flask:** Backend framework for handling requests and routing
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Frontend development for creating user interfaces
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database used for storing URLs and user information
- **Bootstrap:** Frontend CSS framework for styling and responsiveness
- **Google Safe Browsing API:** Ensures the URLs are checked against Googleâ€™s safety database
